# 🖼️ Lightbox Viewer

## 💡 Project Description

This project implements a functional, standalone **Lightbox Viewer**, a common UI pattern used to display images in a centralized modal overlay while dimming the rest of the page content.

Users can click on any thumbnail image in the gallery to trigger the lightbox, displaying the full-sized image with controls to close the viewer either via a close button or by clicking outside the image.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure of the page and image gallery.
- **CSS3:** Styling of gallery thumbnails, hover effects, and the lightbox overlay with proper positioning.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Controls dynamic behavior of the lightbox, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and toggling visibility.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Interactive Gallery:** Hover effects on thumbnails with smooth transitions and subtle movement.
2. **Lightbox Overlay:** Clicking an image opens a modal with a darkened background.
3. **Dynamic Image Loading:** The lightbox displays the full-sized image corresponding to the thumbnail clicked.
4. **Close Controls:** Close the lightbox with the close button or by clicking outside the image.
5. **Responsive Design:** Works well across different screen sizes.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

This project reinforces several core front-end development concepts:

1. **Dynamic DOM Manipulation:** Changing image sources (`src`) and updating UI elements in real-time.
2. **Event Handling:** Adding click listeners to multiple elements for opening and closing the lightbox.
3. **Toggle Visibility:** Managing visibility using CSS and JS, including smooth transitions.
4. **User Experience (UX):** Implementing intuitive interactions and preventing background scroll when the lightbox is open.
5. **CSS Transitions & Transformations:** Hover effects on thumbnails for visual feedback.
